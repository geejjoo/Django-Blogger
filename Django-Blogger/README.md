# Django-Blogger

Django-Blogger is a micro blogging site powered by Django framework with full-fledged support for user
authentication. Users can follow/unfollow multiple users on platform. 

## Getting Started

start playing around by getting your copy of source code by running this command in your terminal

```
git clone https://github.com/goyal-aman/Django-Blogger.git
```

### Prerequisites

You will need various packages to work with this project. So start by creating a virtual envioronment. Run this command in terminal in same directory where you cloned repository
```
python -m venv myvenv
```

and then to activate the environment

If using  bash: ```. myvenv/scripts/activate```

If using windows cmd : ``` myvenv/scripts/activate.bat```

If using windows powershell : ```myvenv/scripts/activate.ps1```


### Installing

Now you need to install all the packages project needs, cd into the project directory containing ```manage.py``` file and run this command

```pip install -r requirments.txt```

this should install all the required packages.


## Running Django Server

To finally use this you need to makemigrations and migrate without which there will be various errors. Run these commands

```python manage.py makemigrations```

```python manage.py migrate```

```python manage.py collectstatic```

before running development server test if everything is working properly 

```python manage.py test```

this will run all test, made to confirm is everything is working properly. If any of the test fails, try again from the beggining and if problem persists create an issue.


and finally you are ready to run development server by using this  command

```python manage.py runserver```

but you still cannot login to admin page for which you need to create the admin user, use this command to create the admin user

````python manage.py createsuperuser````

and You are done. Enjoy
